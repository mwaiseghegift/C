A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.




*While loop
A while loop in C programming repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.


Syntax

while(condition) {
   statement(s);
}




*For Loop
A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.
Syntax

The syntax of a for loop in C programming language is −

for ( init; condition; increment ) {
   statement(s);
}




*Do While Loop
A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least one time.

Syntax

do {
   statement(s);
} while( condition );




The Infinite Loop

A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false
